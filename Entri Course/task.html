    <h1>LORD SHIVA</h1> 
    <h2>About Shiva</h2>
    <p>He is one of the most complex and mysterious gods in the Hindu tradition because of his paradoxical nature.<b>Shiva is generally thought to have originated from Rudra, a god worshipped in the Indus Valley during the Vedic period.</b> Rudra was a hunter and a storm god, and was very fierce in his ways.</p><hr>
  <h3>Full form of Shiva</h3>
  <p>Shiva, (Sanskrit: “Auspicious One”) also spelled Śiwa or Śiva, one of the main deities of Hinduism, whom Shaivites worship as the supreme god. Among his common epithets are Shambhu (“Benign”), Shankara (“Beneficent”), Mahesha (“Great Lord”), and Mahadeva (“Great God”)</p><hr>
  <h3>Shiva's birth </h3>
  <p>Many believe that God Shiva is a Sayambhu – which means He is not born from a human body. He was created automatically! He was there when there was nothing and He will remain even after everything is destructed. That is why; he is also loving called as the 'Adi-Dev' which means the 'Oldest God of the Hindu mythology.</p><hr>
  <h3>Lord Shiva's Third Eye</h3>
  <p>One of these symbols is his third eye, seen in the centre of his forehead; hence he is often referred to as Tryambaka Deva (literally meaning “three-eyed lord”). His right eye is believed to be the sun, the left eye is the moon and his third eye represents fire.</p><hr>
  <h3 id="lord shiva's power">Lord Shiva's power</h3>
  <p>Shiva's role is to destroy the universe in order to re-create it. Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change.</p><hr>
  <h3>Lord Shiva's alive</h3>
  <P>Mount Kailash is held as the abode of Shiva.</P>
  <h3>Mount Kailash</h3>
  <p>In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash as well as a householder with his wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.</p><hr>
  <h2>Shiva, Parvati & Ganesha</h2>
  <p>Shiva's wife was Parvati, often incarnated as Kali and Durga. She was in fact a reincarnation of Sati (or Dakshayani), the daughter of the god Daksha. Daksha did not approve of Sati's marriage to Shiva and even went further and held a special sacrificial ceremony to all the gods except Shiva. Outraged at this slight, Sati threw herself on the sacrificial fire. Shiva reacted to this tragedy by creating two demons (Virabhadra and Rudrakali) from his hair who wreaked havoc on the ceremony and beheaded Daksha. The other gods appealed to Shiva to end the violence and, complying, he brought Daksha back to life but with the head of a ram (or goat). Sati was eventually reincarnated as Parvati in her next life and she re-married Shiva.</p><hr>
