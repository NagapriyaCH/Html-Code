<h3>About my team</h3>
<p>I enjoy working in a team environment, and I get along well with people. In my past work experience, I implemented a system to help organize the communication between my coworkers to enhance our productivity as a team. It helped us delegate tasks more easily, which led to earlier completion dates.</p><hr/>
